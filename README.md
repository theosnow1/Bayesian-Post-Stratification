# Bayesian-Post-Stratification
RMarkdown pipeline comparing deterministic vs Bayesian post-stratification weights for ATE estimation in pre-stratified samples. Features data fallback, treatment/outcome simulation, quasi-Poisson modeling, posterior sampling, and visualizations of weight and effect uncertainty. This is not meant as a reproducible pipeline, as the data leveraged for this project contains PHI. This is a record of work.
